Abbot Test Suite README
=======================

Test Module Organization
------------------------

The test suite contains the following modules. They goal was to strike a balance between making it
easy to find the test for a component, while also making it easy to ensure that corresponding aspects
of similar components are tested similarly. (For example, to ensure a 404 is tested in GET requests
for both SimpleHandler and ComplexHandler).

Request-based tests in SimpleHandler and ComplexHandler:

- test_get_unit.py for basic_get(), get_handler(), and get() in both handlers
- test_get_integration.py for GET requests in both handlers
- test_search_unit.py for search_handler(), and search() in both handlers
- test_search_integration.py for SEARCH requests in both handlers
- test_head.py for head() and HEAD requests in both handlers
- test_options.py for options() and OPTIONS requests in both handlers

Module- and class-level methods and functions:

- test_simple_handler.py for SimpleHandler (e.g., TestFormatRecord)
- test_complex_handler.py for ComplexHandler (e.g., TestLookUpXrefs)

Other modules:

- test_fixtures.py for the test fixtures themselves, which are held in shared.py
- test_holy_orders.py for HolyOrders
- test_root_handler.py for the the "abbot.handlers" module
- test_search_grammar.py for the "abbot.search_grammar" module
- test_util.py for the "abbot.util" module

Testing Approach
----------------

TODO: I'll write about how I test. Specifically I'll talk about the things I call "unit tests" in
comparison to "integration tests," and clarify that (at the moment?) none of them integrate the full
system (i.e., none of them include Solr) which I might say is an "acceptance test," or whatever. I
also have to offer a brief overview of how to use the TestHandler fixture, especially the Solr mock,
and whatever else I come up with there.

This will be part of GitHub issue #84.
