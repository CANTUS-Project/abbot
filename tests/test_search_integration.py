Integration tests for SEARCH requests in SimpleHandler and ComplexHandler.
'''
# NOTE: so long as no call is made into the "pysolrtornado" library, which happens when functions
#       "in front of" pysolrtornado are replaced by mocks, the test classes needn't use tornado's
#       asynchronous TestCase classes.

# pylint: disable=protected-access
# That's an important part of testing! For me, at least.
